    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

The sum of matrices is determined by the sum in F-algebra, and the product of matrices is determined by the product of mappings. The system of equations, whose matrix is a matrix of mappings, is called a system of additive equations. I considered the methods of solving system of additive equations. As an example, I consider the solution of a system of linear equations over the complex field provided that the equations contain unknown quantities and their conjugates.\\n  Linear mappings of algebra over a commutative ring preserve the operation of addition in algebra and the product of elements of the algebra by elements of the ring.

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. This process flow helps developers update data sources without retraining the model and makes RAG a scalable and cost-effective solution for building LLM applications in domains like customer support, knowledge bases and internal search. This is called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), as you would retrieve the relevant data and use it as augmented context for the LLM. With RAG architecture, organizations can deploy any LLM model and augment it to return relevant results for their organization by giving it a small amount of their data without the costs and time of fine-tuning or pretraining the model.', 'url': 'https://www.databricks.com/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag'}\n",

      "## Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent novae are a fascinating astronomical phenomenon where a white dwarf star in a binary system undergoes multiple nova eruptions over time. Radio observations have provided critical insights into the mass ejection, velocity, and other characteristics of these novae. Below is a summary of key radio observations on several recurrent novae:\n",
      "\n",
      "### T Pyxidis\n",
      "T Pyx is a well-studied recurrent nova, albeit an unusual one. A notable study conducted during the 2011 outburst used radio observations to investigate the dynamics of its ejecta. The findings indicated that the radio flux was initially low, rising significantly only after about 50 days. This suggested that the radio-emitting material was either very cold or expanding slowly. The study estimated a significant mass ejection, about \\(1-30 \\times 10^{-5} M_\\odot\\), which is notably higher than typical for recurrent novae [source](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N).\n",
      "\n",
      "### RS Ophiuchi\n",
      "RS Ophiuchi is one of the most well-documented recurrent novae with respect to radio emissions. Several key observations have been made across its multiple outbursts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **1985 Outburst**: This event was the first recorded instance of a radio detection associated with a recurrent nova event. The rapid expansion of the radio source was observed, suggesting a velocity of up to 4200 km/s. The radio emissions, likely synchrotron radiation, provided insights into the dynamics of the expanding nova shell [source](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...305L..71H/abstract).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **2021 Outburst**: More recent observations during the 2021 outburst included low-frequency radio studies, offering further insights into the magnetic fields and particle acceleration processes associated with such explosive events [source](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/1/132/7159730).\n",
      "\n",
      "### V3890 Sagittarii\n",
      "The recurrent nova V3890 Sgr exhibits radio emissions observable across several wavelengths, extending from radio to gamma rays. These emissions provide a comprehensive view of the physical processes occurring during the eruptions, aiding in the understanding of the recurrence and energy release mechanisms in such systems [source](https://pos.sissa.it/460/037/).\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Insights\n",
      "Radio observations across different recurrent novae consistently reveal that these systems can have complex and varied ejecta dynamics, with mass ejections and velocities varying significantly from one nova to another. The non-thermal nature of radio emissions, often delayed relative to optical outbursts, indicates complex interactions in the nova environment, including shock interactions and delayed energy release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, radio studies continue to be an invaluable tool in expanding our understanding of recurrent novae, providing details not easily accessible through optical observations alone.\n",

      "Recurrent novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variables that undergo multiple nova outbursts. They consist of a white dwarf accreting matter from a companion star, leading to thermonuclear runaways. Studying these systems through radio observations can provide insights into their ejecta dynamics, mass ejection processes, and the circumstellar material.\n",

      "   - **Study**: \"Shocks and Ejecta Mass: Radio Observations of Nova V1723 Aql,\" by Jennifer H. S. Weston et al.\n",
      "   - **Summary**: The study focuses on the radio light curves of nova V1723 Aql, noting that they rise and fall over several months to years. One of the key findings is that the radio ejecta mass, determined through models, exceeds theoretical expectations. This discrepancy is explored using observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). An unexpected initial bump in the radio light curve suggests the presence of shocks in the outer ejected shell, which fade over time [Weston et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2265v2).\n",

The discussion emphasizes the common features found in these observations, which could give clues about the progenitor's properties and nova processes [Mason & Walters, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2776v1).\n",

      "### Implications and Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio astronomy offers a powerful tool for probing the physical conditions of novae. The observations can quantify ejecta masses, reveal shock interactions, and offer clues to the mass-loss history of these explosive events. These insights are crucial for understanding the lifecycle of recurrent novae and their influence on surrounding interstellar environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, technological advancements, such as the improvements in the VLA, have enhanced the ability to capture detailed radio data, allowing more accurate models and theoretical predictions to be tested against observational results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, radio observations of recurrent novae are vital for unraveling the complexities of these explosive systems and contribute to the broader understanding of stellar evolution and the dynamics of binary star systems.\n",

      "   - **Study**: \"Shocks and Ejecta Mass: Radio Observations of Nova V1723 Aql,\" by Jennifer H. S. Weston et al.\n",
      "   - **Summary**: The study focuses on the radio light curves of nova V1723 Aql, noting that they rise and fall over several months to years. One of the key findings is that the radio ejecta mass, determined through models, exceeds theoretical expectations. This discrepancy is explored using observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). An unexpected initial bump in the radio light curve suggests the presence of shocks in the outer ejected shell, which fade over time [Weston et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2265v2).\n",

      "   - **Study**: \"Lesson learned from (some) recurrent novae,\" by Elena Mason and Frederick M. Walters.\n",
      "   - **Summary**: This study presents spectra of recurrent novae YY Dor and nova LMC 2009, highlighting their similar spectral characteristics and suggesting a uniformity in the white dwarf progenitors and post-outburst phases among similar novae. The discussion emphasizes the common features found in these observations, which could give clues about the progenitor's properties and nova processes [Mason & Walters, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2776v1).\n",

      "### Implications and Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio astronomy offers a powerful tool for probing the physical conditions of novae. The observations can quantify ejecta masses, reveal shock interactions, and offer clues to the mass-loss history of these explosive events. These insights are crucial for understanding the lifecycle of recurrent novae and their influence on surrounding interstellar environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, technological advancements, such as the improvements in the VLA, have enhanced the ability to capture detailed radio data, allowing more accurate models and theoretical predictions to be tested against observational results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, radio observations of recurrent novae are vital for unraveling the complexities of these explosive systems and contribute to the broader understanding of stellar evolution and the dynamics of binary star systems.\n"
